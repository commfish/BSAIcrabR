#' Get Total Catch
#'
#' Estimate total catch from observer CPUE data
#' @param pot_data NULL. Observer count pot data in the same format as the output of `load_pot_dump()`
#' @param crab_data NULL. Observer measure pot data in the same format as the output of `load_crab_dump()`
#' @param ft_data NULL. Fish ticket data with fields 'crab_year', 'fishery', 'effort' and whatever variables are specified in by.
#' @param stock NULL. Character string stock abbreviation: BSSC, WBT, EBT, BBRKC, EAG, WAG, PIGKC, SMBKC, PIBKC, PIRKC, WAIRKC.
#' @param by NULL. Vector of column names other than crab year, fishery, and group to use as a grouping variable.
#' @param lump T/F. Lump shell condition into new and old (TRUE) or not (FALSE). Default = TRUE.
#' @param units NULL. Unit of measurement, "t" or "lb". Default = "t".
#' @return Data frame including crab year, fishery, grouping variables, effort, average weight, and total catch. Average weights used for expansion to weight are only based on crab year, fishery, and sex. No other 'by' variables are included here, so that the sum of total catch by variables (i.e., sex and shell condition) will equal the total catch by sex.
